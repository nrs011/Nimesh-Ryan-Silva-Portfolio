            Discuss the importance of systems security and how the loss of
            security can affect considerably business operations. Use at least
            one real-world example to support your answer.

          System security is the protection of information and property from
          theft, corruption, and other types of damage, while allowing the
          information and property to remain accessible and productive. The
          importance is that it includes the development and implementation of
          security counter measures. There are a number of different approaches
          to computer system security, including the use of a firewall, data
          encryption, passwords and biometrics. The loss of security affecting a
          business operation can have dramatic and long term effects on a
          company, such as reputable damage, theft, financial losses, and fines.
          A real-world example would be the 2011 PlayStation Network outage. The
          attack occurred between April 17 and April 19, 2011, forcing Sony to
          turn off the PlayStation Network on April 20. On May 4, Sony confirmed
          that personally identifiable information from each of the 77 million
          affected accounts had been exposed. The outage lasted 23 days. At the
          time, it was one of the largest data security breaches in history. The
          outage costs were $171 million. Sony stated their belief that
          Anonymous, a decentralized unorganized loosely affiliated group of
          hacktivists (hackers and activists) may have performed the attack, but
          no Anons claimed any involvement. Credit card data was encryption, but
          Sony admitted that other user information was not encrypted at the
          time of the intrusion. While the passwords that were stored were not
          "encrypted", they were transformed using a cryptographic hash
          function. Sony was fined $395k for security measures so poor they did
          not comply with the British law. As compensation to users, Sony gave
          out free PS3 games to help alleviate some of their losses. As a result
          of the breach, Sony made changes to their terms and conditions.
